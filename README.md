# Mutar
**Mu**table**T**yped**Ar**ray - _/mu'taÉ¾/, spanish for to change, mutate_

**Mutar** is a toolkit to interact with typed arrays and modify them (or let's say a kit to emulate modification) and a constructor for a special object. It is a very convenient way to handle binary data. If constructed, the array behaves pretty much as a regular array. You can concatenate, pop, shift, unshift... On top of that the type can be changed from - let's say - Uint8 to Float64. Also zero padding can get trimmed. 

In reality TypedArrays are not suitable. To emulate mutability, a new array with the desired properties is created. This comes to a price of course. Every time the array "changes", a new TypedArray is allocated in memory. Keep that in mind when using it, if this is critical to you.

## Toolkit
If you want to work with an existing TypedArray, you can use **Mutar** to analyse and modify it. Let's for example take a Uint32Array for the integer **400**.

```js
const Uint32 = new Uint32Array([400])
```
Mutar comes with some functions to analyse the given object. (Let us forget for a moment that we exactly know what kind of object it is).

### Analysis
```js
const Uint32 = new Uint32Array([400]);
const regularArray = [400];

// Test if is a TypedArray //
Mutar.isTypedArray(Uint32);                 // -> true
Mutar.isTypedArray(regularArray);           // -> false


// Get the type //
Mutar.getType(Uint32);                      // -> "Uint32Array"


// Test if array is of type xy //

// test for Uint32Array
Mutar.isTypeOf(Uint32, "Uint32Array");      // -> true

// you can also use the Uint32 constructor as input
Mutar.isTypeOf(Uint32, Uint32Array);        // -> true

// test for Int8Array (this time a shortcut for the type)
Mutar.isTypeOf(Uint32, "Int8");             // -> false

// test the "wrong" type
Mutar.isTypeOf(regularArray, Uint32Array);  // -> false
```

Let's now take a look at the fun part: the modification.

### Modification
```js
const Uint32 = new Uint32Array([400]);

// easy start: create a copy (clone) of a TypedArray
// (changes on the clone will not effect the original)
const clone = Mutar.clone(Uint32);

// converting (e.g. BigInt64)
const BigInt = convert(Uint32, "BigInt"); 

```
